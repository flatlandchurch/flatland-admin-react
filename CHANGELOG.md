## [0.2.1] 2018-10-30

### Fixed
* Fixed an issue where devotionals were not getting sent out when a blog post gets created.

## [0.2.0] 2018-10-28

### Added

* Creating a blog post now comes with a slightly revised editor. Gone is the obtrusive jumbotron and the hapless automated image picker.
* When you create a blog post, you will now receive messaging after a redirect, letting you know the post was saved.
* Blog creation will now validate that all required fields are required before trying to publish with appropriate warning messages above the form.
* The current version of the app can now be found at the bottom of the page.
